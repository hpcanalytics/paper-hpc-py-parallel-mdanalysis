\subsection{MDAnalysis}
\label{sec:mda}

Simulation data exist in trajectories in the form of time series of atom positions and sometimes velocities. These come in a plethora of different and idiosyncratic file formats. 
\package{MDAnalysis}~\citep{Gowers:2016aa,Michaud-Agrawal:2011fu} is a widely used open source library to analyze trajectory files with an object oriented interface. 
The library is written in Python, with time critical code in C/Cython. 
\package{MDAnalysis} supports most file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format and enables accessing data stored in trajectories. 
 
As a test case that is representative of a common task in the analysis of biomolecular simulation trajectories we chose the calculation of a timeseries of the minimal structural root mean square distance $\text{RMSD}(t)=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\delta_{i}(t)^{2}}$ (\textbf{RMSD}), where $\delta_{i}$ is the distance between atom $i$ at time $t$ and its position in a reference structure \cite{Lea96, Mura:2014kx}. 
The RMSD is calculated for the  C$_{\alpha}$ atoms of a subset of protein residues after 
optimal superposition with the QCPROT algorithm~\cite{Liu:2010kx,Theobald:2005vn} (implemented in Cython and available through the \texttt{MDAnalysis.analysis.rms} module \cite{Gowers:2016aa}), as outlined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:RMSD}. 
In the RMSD algorithm, a translation and rigid body rotation are found that minimize the RMSD between the coordinates at time $t$ and the reference coordinates \cite{Liu:2010kx}. 
The RMSD of this optimum superposition is reported for each time step $t$.
The RMSD is used to show the rigidity of protein domains and more generally characterizes structural changes.
The time complexity for the RMSD Algorithm~\ref{alg:RMSD} is $\mathcal{O}(T \times N^{2})$~\cite{Liu:2010kx} where $T$ is the number of frames in the trajectory and $N$ the number of particles included in the RMSD calculation.

\subsection{MPI for Python (\package{mpi4py})}
MPI for Python (\package{mpi4py}) is a Python wrapper written over Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard and allows any Python program to employ multiple processors \cite{Dalcin:2011aa, Dalcin:2005aa}.
Python is widely used in the scientific community because it facilitates rapid development of small scripts and code prototypes as well as development of large applications and highly portable and reusable modules and libraries.
Based on the efficiency tests \cite{Dalcin:2011aa, Dalcin:2005aa}, the performance degradation due to using \package{mpi4py} is not prohibitive and the overhead introduced by \package{mpi4py} is far smaller than the overhead associated to the use of interpreted versus compiled languages \cite{GAiN}.
Overheads in \package{mpi4py} are small compared to C code if efficient raw memory buffers are used for communication \cite{Dalcin:2011aa}.

\subsection{Global Arrays toolkit}
The \emph{Global Arrays} (GA) toolkit provides users with a language interface that allows them to distribute data while maintaining the type of global index space and programming syntax similar to what is available when programming on a single processor \cite{GA}.
It allows manipulating physically distributed dense multi-dimensional arrays without explicitly defining communication and synchronization between processes.
The underlying communication is determined by a runtime environment, which defaults to the \emph{Communication runtime for Extreme Scale} (ComEx) \cite{Daily:2014aa}.
ComEx uses shared memory for intra-node communication and inter-node communication employs ComEx with MPI.
\emph{Global Arrays in NumPy} (GAiN) extends GA to Python through Numpy \cite{GAiN}. 
The Global Arrays toolkit provides functions to create global arrays (\texttt{ga\_create()}) and to copy data to (\texttt{ga\_put()}) and from (\texttt{ga\_get()}) such a global array,  as well as additional functions for copying between arrays and freeing them \cite{GAiN}.
When a global array is created (\texttt{ga\_create()}) each process will create an array of the same shape and size, physically located in the local memory space of that process \cite{GA}. 
The GA library maintains a list of all these memory locations, which can be queried with the \texttt{ga\_access()} function.
Using a pointer returned by \texttt{ga\_access()}, one can directly modify the data that is local to each process.
When a process tries to access a block of data the request is first decomposed into individual blocks representing the contribution to the total request from the data held locally on each process (\textit{B. J. Palmer and J. Daily, personal communication}).
The requesting process then makes individual requests to each of the remote processes. 

Algorithm \ref{alg:GA} describes the RMSD algorithm in combination with a Global Arrays.
In this algorithm, we use Global Arrays instead of the message passing paradigm to investigate if we can reduce the communication cost.

\subsection{MPI and Parallel HDF5}
HDF5 is a structured self-describing hierarchical data format which is the standard mechanism for storing large quantities of numerical data in Python (\url{http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5}, \cite{pythonhdf5}).
Parallel HDF5 (\package{PHDF5}) typically sits on top of a MPI-IO layer and can use MPI-IO optimizations. 
In \package{PHDF5}, all file accesses are coordinated through the MPI library; otherwise, multiple processes would compete over accessing over the same file on disk. 
MPI-based applications work by launching multiple parallel instances of the Python interpreter which communicate with each other via the MPI library. 
\package{HDF5} itself handles nearly all the details involved with coordinating file access when the shared file is opened through the \emph{mpio} driver.
In addition, MPI communicator should be supplied as well and the users also need to follow some constraints for data consistency \cite{pythonhdf5}.

MPI has two flavors of operation: collective, which means that all processes have to participate in the same order, and independent, which means each process can perform the operation or not and the order also does not matter  \cite{pythonhdf5}.
With \package{PHDF5}, modifications to file metadata must be done collectively and although all processes perform the same task, they do not wait until the others catch up \cite{pythonhdf5}. 
Other tasks and any type of data operations can be performed independently by processes.
In the present study, we use independent operations.
