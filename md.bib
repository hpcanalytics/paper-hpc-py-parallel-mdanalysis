	Abstract = {The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the single global archive of experimentally determined three-dimensional (3D) structure data of biological macromolecules. Since 2003, the PDB has been managed by the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org), an international consortium that collaboratively oversees deposition, validation, biocuration, and open access dissemination of 3D macromolecular structure data. The PDB Core Archive houses 3D atomic coordinates of more than 144 000 structural models of proteins, DNA/RNA, and their complexes with metals and small molecules and related experimental data and metadata. Structure and experimental data/metadata are also stored in the PDB Core Archive using the readily extensible wwPDB PDBx/mmCIF master data format, which will continue to evolve as data/metadata from new experimental techniques and structure determination methods are incorporated by the wwPDB. Impacts of the recently developed universal wwPDB OneDep deposition/validation/biocuration system and various methods-specific wwPDB Validation Task Forces on improving the quality of structures and data housed in the PDB Core Archive are described together with current challenges and future plans.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental challenge in biological research is achieving an atomic-level description and mechanistic understanding of the function of biomolecules. Techniques for biomolecular simulations have undergone substantial developments, and their accuracy and scope have expanded considerably. Progress has been made through an increasingly tight integration of experiments and simulations, with experiments being used to refine simulations and simulations used to interpret experiments. Here we review the underpinnings of this progress, including methods for more efficient conformational sampling, accuracy of the physical models used, and theoretical approaches to integrate experiments and simulations. These developments are enabling detailed studies of complex biomolecular assemblies.},

@article{10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004568,
	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Many proteins are nanomachines that perform mechanical or chemical work by changing their three-dimensional shape and cycle between multiple conformational states. Computer simulations of such conformational transitions provide mechanistic insights into protein function but such simulations have been challenging. In particular, it is not clear how to quantitatively compare current simulation methods or to assess their accuracy. To that end, we present a general and flexible computational framework for quantifying transition paths?by measuring mutual geometric similarity?that, compared with existing approaches, requires minimal a-priori assumptions and can take advantage of full atomic detail alongside heuristic information derived from intuition. Using our <italic>Path Similarity Analysis</italic> (PSA) framework in parallel with several existing quantitative approaches, we examine transitions generated for a toy model of a transition and two biological systems, the enzyme adenylate kinase and diphtheria toxin. Our results show that PSA enables the quantitative comparison of different path sampling methods and aids the identification of potentially important atomistic motions by exploiting geometric information in transition paths. The method has the potential to enhance our understanding of transition path sampling methods, validate them, and to provide a new approach to analyzing macromolecular conformational transitions.</p>},

	Abstract = {The field of biomolecular simulation has matured to the level that detailed, accurate, and functionally relevant information that complements experimental data about the structure, dynamics, and interactions of biomolecules can now be routinely discovered. This has been enabled by access to large scale and heterogeneous high performance computing resources, including special purpose hardware. The improved performance of modern simulation methods coupled with hardware advances is shifting the rate-limiting steps of common biomolecular simulations of small- to moderately-sized systems from the generation of data (for example via production molecular dynamics simulations that used to take weeks or even months) to the pre- and post-processing phases of the workflow, namely simulation set-up and data processing, management, and analysis. Access to heterogeneous computational resources enables a broader exploration of biomolecular structure and dynamics by facilitating distinct aspects of typical biomolecular simulation workflows.},

@article{Mura:2014kx,
	Abstract = { The biomolecules in and around a living cell -- proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and carbohydrates -- continuously sample myriad conformational states that are thermally accessible at physiological temperatures. Simultaneously, a given biomolecule also samples (and is sampled by) a rapidly fluctuating local environment comprising other biopolymers, small molecules, water, ions, etc. that diffuse to within a few nanometres, leading to inter-molecular contacts that stitch together large supramolecular assemblies. Indeed, all biological systems can be viewed as dynamic networks of molecular interactions. As a complement to experimentation, molecular simulation offers a uniquely powerful approach to analyse biomolecular structure, mechanism and dynamics; this is possible because the molecular contacts that define a complicated biomolecular system are governed by the same physical principles (forces and energetics) that characterise individual small molecules, and these simpler systems are relatively well-understood. With modern algorithms and computing capabilities, simulations are now an indispensable tool for examining biomolecular assemblies in atomic detail, from the conformational motion in an individual protein to the diffusional dynamics and inter-molecular collisions in the early stages of formation of cellular-scale assemblies such as the ribosome. This text introduces the physicochemical foundations of molecular simulations and docking, largely from the perspective of biomolecular interactions. },
