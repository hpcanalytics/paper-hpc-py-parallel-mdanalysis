\subsection{Effect of \RcompIO on Scaling Performance}
\label{sec:increasedworkload}

For an $X$-fold increase in workload, we expected the workload for the computation to scale with $X$ as $\tcomp(X) =  N_{\text{frames}}^{\text{total}} X \overline{\tcomp^{\text{frame}}}$ while the read I/O workload $\tIO(X) = N_{\text{frames}}^{\text{total}} \overline{\tIO^{\text{frame}}}$ (number of frames times the average time to read a frame) should remain independent of $X$.
Therefore, the ratio for any $X$ should be $\RcompIO(X) = \tcomp(X)/\tIO(X) = X \RcompIO(X=1)$, i.e.,  $\RcompIO$ should just linearly scale with the workload factor $X$.
The measured $\RcompIO$ ratios of 11, 19, 27 for the increased computational workloads agreed with this theoretical analysis, as shown in Table \ref{tab:load-ratio}.

\caption[Change in load-ratio with RMSD workload]{Change in $\RcompIO$ ratio with change in the RMSD workload $X$.
  The RMSD workload was artificially increased in order to examine the effect of compute to I/O ratio on the performance.
  The reported compute and I/O time were measured based on the serial version using one core.
  The theoretical $\RcompIO$ (see text) is provided for comparison.}

We performed the experiments with increased workload to measure the effect of the $\RcompIO$ ratio (Eq.~\ref{eq:Compute-IO}) on performance (Figure~\ref{fig:tcomp_tIO_effect}).
The strong scaling performance as measured by the speed-up $S(N)$ improved with increasing $\RcompIO$ ratio (Figure \ref{fig:S1_tcomp_tIO_effect}).
The calculations consistently showed better scaling performance to larger numbers of cores for higher $\RcompIO$ ratios, e.g., $N=56$ cores for the $70\times$ RMSD task. 
The speed-up and efficiency approached their ideal value for each processor count with increasing $\RcompIO$ ratio (Figures \ref{fig:S2_tcomp_tIO_effect} and \ref{fig:E_tcomp_tIO_effect}).
Even for moderately compute-bound workloads, such as the $40\times$ and $70\times$ RMSD tasks, increasing the computational workload over I/O reduced the impact of stragglers even though they still contributed to large variations in timing across different ranks and thus irregular scaling.
